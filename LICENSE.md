# NASA Images and Media Usage Guidelines

NASA content – images, audio, video, and media files used in the rendition of 3-dimensional models, such as texture maps and polygon data in any format – generally are not subject to copyright in the United States. You may use this material for educational or informational purposes, including photo collections, textbooks, public exhibits, computer graphical simulations and Internet Web pages. This general permission extends to personal Web pages.

News outlets, schools, and text-book authors may use NASA content without needing explicit permission, subject to compliance with these guidelines. NASA content used in a factual manner that does not imply endorsement may be used without needing explicit permission. NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the material. NASA occasionally uses copyright-protected material of third parties with permission on its website. Those images will be marked identified as copyright protected with the name of the copyright holder. NASA’s use does not convey any rights to others to use the same material. Those wishing to use copyright protected material of third parties must contact the copyright holder directly.

## COMMERCIAL USE

For use of NASA images in books, clearances may be necessary for images that include any NASA logos or NASA employees to be used as cover art or in promotional content.  Otherwise, NASA imagery can be generally used editorially within published works that are not promotional in nature.

If the NASA material is to be used for commercial purposes, including advertisements, it must not explicitly or implicitly convey NASA’s endorsement of commercial goods or services.

Commercials and promotional content cannot be filmed on NASA property.

For commercial use of NASA’s images, emblems, or logos on merchandise or products refer to the Merchandise Guidelines and Approvals page.

### Media including Identifiable Persons

If a NASA image, audio, video or media includes an identifiable person, using the media for commercial purposes may infringe that person’s right of privacy or publicity, and permission should be obtained from the person.

Astronauts or employees who are currently employed by NASA cannot have their names, likenesses or other personality traits displayed or position title used on any commercial products, advertisements, promotional material or commercial product packaging.

For guidance on commercial use on merchandise please refer to NASA’s Merchandise Guidelines.

For more information on using NASA content for commercial purposes, please read NASA Advertising Guidelines and Merchandise Guidelines.  Any questions regarding use of NASA content, or any NASA emblems, should be directed to nasa-merchandise-&-brand-team@mail.nasa.gov in NASA’s Office of Communications at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

Astronauts or NASA employees who are retired from the agency can grant permission for the use of their names, likenesses or other personality traits in their discretion, but their former affiliation with NASA may not be used to promote any product, service or activity. For deceased astronauts or employees, their estates may retain rights in the deceased person’s name, likeness or other personality traits, so permission may still be needed.

There are many images (moving and still) which have been made publicly available by NASA featuring astronauts in space suits where the astronauts face may be shielded or not easily recognizable, but where some other aspect of the photo may indicate the astronaut’s identity – like a name tag or simply the historical context of the photo. In such a case, the restrictions set forth above may still be applicable, so permission may still be necessary.
